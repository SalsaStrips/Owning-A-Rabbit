	<p>There's quite a bit of supplies that you'll need before adopting your furry friend. A majority of this you can buy one time (xpen, blankets, litter box, etc), of course some items will need to be replaced over time. But in the long run you'll save on money. Items that are reoccuring purchases are things like pellets, hay, litter, treats, and toys (if your new friend destroys them).</p>
